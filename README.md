This is a C++ implementation of the classic game Battleship, featuring a simple AI opponent. The code can be compiled and run on any machine with a C++ compiler installed.

Usage
To run the game, navigate to the src directory and run the main executable. The game will prompt the user to press any key, and will then begin the game. The AI will strategically select coordinates to attack, and the game will continue until either the player or AI has sunk all of the other player's ships.
